    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Luyuan is a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Assoc Prof Mandar Chitre and Dr. Hari Vishnu. 

Her research interests include field robotics in challenging environments and applied machine learning in underwater acoustic communication. Her current research focuses on applying machine learning to solve real-time image transmission challenges in underwater robotics, with the goal of enhancing the tetherless control of remotely operated underwater vehicles. In 2024, Luyuan was honored with the _IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society (OES) Women in Engineering Propel_ award for her contributions to the field. In addition to her research, she has actively contributed to the academic community by organizing several international conferences, workshops and competitions. She is also the editor of _IEEE OES Student Newsletter_. 

Apart from her academic interests, Luyuan has a strong passion for tech entreprenurship. She also enjoys tennis, scuba diving, playing guitar, cold places and hot sake. -->
