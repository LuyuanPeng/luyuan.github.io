abstract: We introduce an architecture designed for wireless Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) operations during intervention surveys. Using the recent advancements in 3D modeling, visual odometry, video compression, and underwater communication, our approach aims to facilitate fully wireless ROV operations. The proposed architecture comprises several modular blocks, each with versatile applications spanning diverse domains, including multiplayer gaming, remote rover control and video transmission over a low-bandwidth connection. This comprehensive framework signifies progress in ROV operations, replacing the traditional physical tether with a software-defined virtual tether.
