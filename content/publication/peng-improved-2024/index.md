abstract: We investigate the performance of image-based pose regressor models in underwater
  environments for relocalization. Leveraging PoseNet and PoseLSTM, we regress a 6-degree-of-freedom
  pose from single RGB images with high accuracy. Additionally, we explore data augmentation
  with stereo camera images to improve model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
  that the models achieve high accuracy in both simulated and clear waters, promising
  effective real-world underwater navigation and inspection applications.
