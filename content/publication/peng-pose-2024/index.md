abstract: High-precision localization is pivotal in underwater reinspection missions.
  Traditional localization methods like inertial navigation systems, Doppler velocity
  loggers, and acoustic positioning face significant challenges and are not cost-effective
  for some applications. Visual localization is a cost-effective alternative in such
  cases, leveraging the cameras already equipped on inspection vehicles to estimate
  poses from images of the surrounding scene. Amongst these, machine learning-based
  pose estimation from images shows promise in underwater environments, performing
  efficient relocalization using models trained based on previously mapped scenes.
  We explore the efficacy of learning-based pose estimators in both clear and turbid
  water inspection missions, assessing the impact of image formats, model architectures
  and training data diversity. We innovate by employing novel view synthesis models
  to generate augmented training data, significantly enhancing pose estimation in
  unexplored regions. Moreover, we enhance localization accuracy by integrating pose
  estimator outputs with sensor data via an extended Kalman filter, demonstrating
  improved trajectory smoothness and accuracy.
